## Project Description
This project focuses on implementing algorithms to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of square matrices and finding the diagonal matrix representation. The implementation is done using Python and Jupyter Notebook, leveraging built-in functions from libraries such as NumPy.

## Project Structure
- **`README.md`**: Overview and instructions.
- **`linear_project.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation and explanation of algorithms.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python libraries required to run the notebook.

## Project Goals
1. Implement eigenvalue and eigenvector calculation algorithms.
2. Develop functions to find the diagonal matrix representation of square matrices.
3. Test the algorithms with sample input matrices.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed, you can install it using `pip install notebook`)

Install other dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
